## Description

This repository is meant as a skeleton framework for a private production, CLiPs, which is designed to assist educational 
professionals in the Southeast Asian markets. While providing me with the ability of exposing the public both to the 
CLiPs project, it will also help others who want to create a multi-platform, responsive mobile/web app (Android and iOS), 
in Angular 2, while incorporating test driven development in a transpiled hard-typed JavaScript.

The database here will be a severally crippled flat JSON file version simply for the sake of example. If you have an interest in this educational 
profiling/reporting system, please do contact me via the 
[issues page](https://github.com/kedweber/clips-frontend-angular2/issues) 
leaving contact information and/or your PRs (Personal Requests).

    |__ app
    |   |- app.component.js
    |   |- app.module.js

## Installation



### Installing Node Package Manager - NPM

NPM is a package manager that can assist us with the management of our backend services. Verify that you are running 
at least node v4.x.x and npm 3.x.x by running node -v and npm -v in a terminal/console window. 
Older versions produce errors with our Angular 2 on TypeScript environment.

[Update npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/update) packages by issuing the following command. If the **-g** flag is specified,
this command will update globally installed packages. This will also install missing packages.
As with all commands that install packages, the **--dev** flag will cause **devDependencies** to be processed as well.

```
npm update [-g] [<pkg>...]
```

### Initializing NPM in Local Project

Issuing the ```npm init``` command within the project's root folder will render a walk-through where you will be
prompted through the creation of the package.json file. Note that for the **main** variable, the default value is
**index.js**. It is more common to distinguish this file name as **gulpfile.js**, but of course you may name it whatever
you desire.

```
~/project$ npm init

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sane defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg> --save` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

}

Is this ok? (yes)
```

### Bower

Similar to NPM, Bower is another package manager, but most commonly leans more towards front-end packages.

```
MacBook-Pro:~/project user$npm install -g bower
/usr/local/bin/bower -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/bower/bin/bower
bower@1.7.9 /usr/local/lib/node_modules/bower
```

Note the reported version **bower@1.7.9** as you will have to assure that this goes into our **devDependencies**
section of our package.json file, as shown in part below, where the **bower** key is given the value of **^1.7.9**:

```
"bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/kedweber/clips-frontend-angular2/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/kedweber/clips-frontend-angular2",
  
  // if the following section doesn't exist add the line below; otherwise, add the bower line within the section
  "devDependencies": {
    "bower": "^1.7.9"
  }
  
}
```
??? Symlink node_modules to global bower

Or if you have plenty of space, have concerns about future compatibility issues with other projects on the same system
or just simply want to keep all your bower installed modules in the local project directory; then
run the following command, which will automatically add the **devDependencies** section to your package.json file.

```
sudo npm install bower --save-dev
```

If you are placing this project into a repository, you may wish to add the line ```node_modules/``` to your **.gitignore** 
file now.

Now we need to generate our **bower.json** file. Move to your **app** directory and issue the following command:

```
~/project/app$ bower init
? name CLiPS-FrontEnd
? description The CLiPs Angular2 Front-end
? main file
? what types of modules does this package expose?
? keywords CLiPs, Angular2, Ionic, Karma, Jasmine, Unit Testing, Mobile, Multi-platform, Educational
? authors (Kedweber <ked@weberstudio.net>) 
? license MIT

? set currently installed components as dependencies? Yes
? add commonly ignored files to the ignore list? Yes

        'node_modules',
        'bower_components',
        'test',
        'tests'
    ]
}

? Looks good? Yes

```

### TypeScript Configuration

See the **Install Angular 2** section if you do not wish to use TypeScript, but prefer Dart or vanilla Javascript. You 
may also wish to opt for reading the manual to [install Angular 2](https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/quickstart.html) with 
all of its options.



### Install Angular 2

The Angular crew expects you to be able to [install Angular 2](https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/quickstart.html) in 5 minutes. 
First you will have to decide which language you will use to write your Angular code. I will be using **TypeScript** here, but
you can chose between:

    Javascript
    Dart by Google
    TypeScript by Microsoft and Google

Make sure you have prepared your environment in the previous steps.

    (a) Create the project folder
    (b) Add package definition and configuration files
    
        NPM Package Configuration **package.json**
        TypeScript compiler configuration file **tsconfig.json***
        TypeScript definition files indetified by the **typings.json** file
        SystemJS's configuration file **typings.json**

    (c) Install packages
    

### Installing Gulp and Gulp Related Packages Globally

Gulp is a ...

It will need to be installed both globally, and locally within the project folder. You can determine if Gulp is already
installed by issuing the command below. If installed, you will see the version currently installed.

```
~/project$ gulp -v
[11:37:11] CLI version 3.9.1
```

If it is not installed, you can simply do so using NPM to install it globally. You may have to prefix the following
command as the super user; using ```sudo```.

```
npm install -g gulp
```

### Ionic for Cross-Platform Mobile Development

## Unit Testing

### [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/)

[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) is a JavaScript test runner, which we can use to generate our test reports. It can be setup to run in multiple
browsers. Karma supports multiple test frameworks, including [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). 

Check out the blog post at [Google Testing](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2012/11/testacular-spectacular-test-runner-for.html) 
for an interesting insight on why Karma was born.

**NOTE:** This may be passe, but it is reported that [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) can not debug Karma. In order to work around this limitation and still 
have build badges on your repository, you will need to create your travis-ci configuration file; ```.travis.yml```, 
as follows or consult the [documentation in depth](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs):

<!-- [//]: # see saucelabs -->

```
language: node_js
node_js:
    - '4' # for karma-runner and Travis-CI
    #- '0.10.33'
before_script:
    # run on chrome
    - 'export CHROME_BIN=chromium-browser'
    # run on firefox
    #- export DISPLAY=:99.0
    # and change package.json's test command to: karma start --browsers Firefox --single-run
    - 'sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start'
    - 'npm install -g bower karma gulp jshint' # grunt-cli if using grunt instead of gulp
    - 'npm install' # install npm packages
    - 'bower install' # install bower packages
script:
    - gulp # run the gulpfile.js
after_script:
    #- 'grunt' # or other command for build, run tests, etc
```

### [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)

[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) is a JavaScript Testing Framework that doesn't depend on any other Javascript Frameworks.

### [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

A "headless" browser, or rather a browser without a user interface in which you can run your [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) tests.

### [Protractor](www.protractortest.org/)

Created by the Google Team and can run end-to-end tests over [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).

### [Angular Mocks](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock) - ngMock modules

[Angular Mocks or ngMock](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing) is a JavaScript Library which allows for
[Angular Services](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_services.asp)
to be mocked and to be injected into tests. It provides a collection of mocks for common Angular Services;
for example, the Angular **$http** Service.

```
npm install [-g] angular-mocks
```

or

```
bower install angular-mocks
```

The mocks are then available at bower_components/angular-mocks/angular-mocks.js.
